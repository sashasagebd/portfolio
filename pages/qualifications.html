                    <h3>Lifegaurd:</h3>
                    <p>As a certified lifeguard, I was responsible for ensuring the safety of all pool patrons. This required strong communication with other lifeguards, composure, and the ability to respond quickly to emergencies. I also taught swim lessons, tailoring a lesson plan and working with big and small groups. I worked this job during the summers of 2021 and 2022, working full-time hours.</p>
